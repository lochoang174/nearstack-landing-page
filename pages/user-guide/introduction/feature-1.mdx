Nearstack focuses on simplifying frontend development for Web3 by utilizing NEAR BOS components, enhanced by AI-generated code suggestions. We have created a platform that allows developers to visualize component relationships through a React flow interface. This approach makes it easier to understand how different components interact, improving developer efficiency and contributing to the growing NEAR ecosystem.
